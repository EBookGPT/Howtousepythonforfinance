# Chapter 10: Portfolio Optimization

Welcome back to our book on How to use python for finance! In the previous chapter, we delved into the exciting world of Financial Statements Analysis. We hope that you enjoyed that chapter, and learned a lot about analyzing financial statements to make informed investment decisions. 

In this chapter, we will be discussing Portfolio Optimization. As an investor, it's important to diversify your portfolio to reduce risk, and maximize returns. Portfolio Optimization involves the process of constructing a portfolio that maximizes returns for a given level of risk. 

We are honored to have a special guest in this chapter, Harry Markowitz. He is a Nobel Prize-winning economist, who introduced the concept of portfolio optimization in 1952, which revolutionized modern portfolio theory. His work emphasizes that it's important to not only focus on the expected returns of an investment, but also its risks. 

We will be using python to demonstrate how to construct an optimized portfolio. We will be using the efficient frontier, which is a mathematical concept that represents the set of optimal portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a given level of risk. 

We hope you are excited to learn more about Portfolio Optimization using python, and how to apply these concepts to your investment decisions. Let's get started!
# Chapter 10: Portfolio Optimization

Welcome back to our book on How to use python for finance! In the previous chapter, we delved into the exciting world of Financial Statements Analysis. We hope that you enjoyed that chapter, and learned a lot about analyzing financial statements to make informed investment decisions. 

In this chapter, we will be discussing Portfolio Optimization. As an investor, it's important to diversify your portfolio to reduce risk, and maximize returns. Portfolio Optimization involves the process of constructing a portfolio that maximizes returns for a given level of risk. 

We are honored to have a special guest in this chapter, Harry Markowitz. He is a Nobel Prize-winning economist, who introduced the concept of portfolio optimization in 1952, which revolutionized modern portfolio theory. His work emphasizes that it's important to not only focus on the expected returns of an investment, but also its risks. 

In this chapter, we will be using python to demonstrate how to construct an optimized portfolio. We will be using the efficient frontier, which is a mathematical concept that represents the set of optimal portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a given level of risk. 

We will start by discussing the basics of portfolio optimization, and then showcase how to calculate the efficient frontier using python. We will also provide examples on how to interpret and use the results of the efficient frontier. 

So buckle up and get ready to learn about Portfolio Optimization with python, in the company of the esteemed Harry Markowitz!
Sure, I'd be happy to explain the code used to solve the Portfolio Optimization problem in python!

Firstly, the problem of Portfolio Optimization involves finding the set of weights that maximize expected returns for a given level of risk. This can be formulated as a quadratic programming (QP) problem. 

To solve the QP problem, we use the `cvxpy` library in python, which is a convex optimization library for modeling and solving mathematical programming problems. 

We start by defining our optimization variables, which are the weights of our portfolio. We use `cvxpy.Variable()` to define our portfolio weights, with the number of variables being the number of assets we are optimizing.

```
import cvxpy as cvx

# Define optimization variables
weights = cvx.Variable(num_assets)
```

Next, we define our portfolio return and risk. We use the expected returns of our assets to calculate an expected portfolio return, and we use the covariance matrix of our asset returns to calculate the portfolio risk. 

```
# Define portfolio return and risk
portfolio_return = expected_returns.T * weights
portfolio_risk = cvx.quad_form(weights, cov_matrix)
```

We use the efficient frontier to determine a set of optimal portfolios that have the highest expected return for a given level of risk. To determine the efficient frontier, we minimize portfolio risk subject to some constraints, which in our case are that the sum of our portfolio weights must equal 1, and that each weight must be between 0 and 1. 

We also set the expected return of our portfolio to be a particular value, and solve the problem multiple times with different expected returns, to generate the curve of the efficient frontier. 

```
# Define optimization problem
objective = cvx.Maximize(portfolio_return)
constraints = [weights >= 0, cvx.sum(weights) == 1]
ef_constraints = [portfolio_return >= ret_level, weights >= 0, cvx.sum(weights) == 1]
ef_problem = cvx.Problem(cvx.Minimize(portfolio_risk), ef_constraints)

# Calculate efficient frontier
ef_curve = []
for ret in np.linspace(min_return, max_return, num_points):
    ef_constraints[0] = portfolio_return >= ret
    ef_problem = cvx.Problem(cvx.Minimize(portfolio_risk), ef_constraints)
    ef_problem.solve()
    ef_curve.append([ret, np.sqrt(portfolio_risk.value), weights.value])
```

Finally, we can use the efficient frontier to construct an optimized portfolio, by choosing the portfolio corresponding to the highest expected return for a given level of risk. 

This is just a brief overview of the code used to solve the Portfolio Optimization problem in python. For more detailed code and explanations, I recommend referring to published journals or online resources that specialize in this area.
